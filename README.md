# LightNIX

Linux distribution that was built with the goal of being lightweight, secure, fast, up-to-date and be well-documented.

## Thanks

The development of this distribution started after coursing *Embedded Systems II* subject in the University of Zaragoza.

In its first steps this distribution has been strongly inspired in [Minimal Linux Live](https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal) (and [its previous build method](https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal-linux-script)), and then in [Rebecca Black OS](https://github.com/n3rdopolis/rebeccablackos).
