The development is made in a branch named *testing*. Only when the project is in a state which may be interesting to record, the changes are merged into *main* and a new version is released.

Anyone interested can propose suggestions and changes via *GitHub Issues* and *Pull Requests*.

> **WARNING**: this distribution is still on alpha versions, so it doesn't exist a stable release yet. Take this into consideration and limit to use the operating system on virtual machines.

## Thanks

The development of this distribution started after coursing *Embedded Systems II* subject in the University of Zaragoza.

In its first steps this distribution has been strongly inspired in [Minimal Linux Live](https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal) (and [its previous build method](https://github.com/ivandavidov/minimal-linux-script)), and then in [Rebecca Black OS](https://github.com/n3rdopolis/rebeccablackos).
